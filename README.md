A Network Approach to Multipolarity in the Liberal International Order - Global Politics course at Hertie School

Can we test such past predictions from theories about the evolution of the LIO and gauge which theories provided the most value? Can we track aspects of the state of the LIO using quantitative measures in a reliable manner? Motivated by these overarching, abstract questions, I address in this study particularly the following leading question: Which effects does globalization have on the multipolarity of the international order?

As the code was written over the christmas holidays, it's a rough draft an needs a thorough clean up, sorry. Have a look at the [paper](https://github.com/heissjl/gp-lio-network/blob/main/Abgabe.pdf) instead.
